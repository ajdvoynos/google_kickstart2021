// Input
// The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow. Each case begins with one line containing six integers S, RA, PA, RB, PB, and C. Respectively, these are the side length of the museum (as a multiple of the side length of a room), the row and position of Alma's starting room, the row and position of Berthe's starting room, and the number of rooms that are under construction. Then, there are C more lines. The i-th of these lines (counting starting from 1) contains two integers Ri and Pi, representing the row and position of the i-th room that is under construction.

// Output
// For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y is the best score that Alma can guarantee for the game, as described above.
