# Prepare for Google Kickstart 2021

### Round F 2021: Finished in position 7000 ðŸ˜‚
Honest feedback: I need to practice way more. I didn't even finish one problem from 2020 and jumped straight into this thinking it would be easier, but it wasn't. I ended up scoring 8/100 and placing 7000 globally. 1st place solved all 4 problems in 20 minutes ðŸ¤¯.

The first problem(TrashBins) was honestly very easy, I kinda had the right approach from the get-go, but implemented it poorly and could not fix it. I decided to scrap that and jump into the second problem (Attractions), which I decided to just bruteforce. I knew there was a solution using dynamic programming, but I didn't have the brainpower to implement that, so I decided to move on to the third problem (StarTrapper) with 45 minutes left. For this one I really had no idea how to solve it, I spent 45 minutes trying to come up with at least a bruteforce idea but no luck. So that was it for me.
